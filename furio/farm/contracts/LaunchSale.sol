/// @title Launch Sale Contract
/// @notice This contract is used as an initial sale of tokens for early adopters. Users will deposit buy orders before the token is minted. The orders will be fulfilled after the token is deployed and the initial liquidity is provided. This contract enables the updater to provide the initial liquidity as well, filling the buy orders in the same block. This ensures that all the orders will be filled at once, preventing faster buyers from getting a better price.
/// @dev The contract can be in one of the 4 states, PENDING, OPEN, FINISHED or CANCELLED. When deployed, the contract starts in the PENDING state. The updater can then switch to the OPEN state by calling the openSale() function. While in the OPEN state, users can call the buy() function. Once the sale is ended, the updater can then call the finishSale() function, which provides the initial liquidity, as well as uses the coin deposited using the buy() function to buy Honey tokens. The users can then claim their purchased Honey tokens using the claim() function, which releases tokens linearly until the end of the vesting period. If the updater deems it neccessary to cancel the sale, they can call the cancelSale() function, setting the contract state to CANCELLED. If the contract state is set to CANCELLED, the buyers can get their coin back using the refund() function.
