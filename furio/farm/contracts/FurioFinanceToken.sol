/// The token supports openzeppelin governance as an erc20 token with voting power. It will be used by a Governor in the future to determine the participants voting powers.
/// @dev AccessControl from openzeppelin implementation is used to handle the minter roles.
/// User with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can grant MINTER_ROLE to any address.
/// The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is intended to be a 2 out of 3 multisig wallet in the beginning and then be moved to governance in the future.
